# Three-Tier Access Control System
## _Ashley Tinashe Shumba (N0161480F)_

## Abstract

The primary goal of the Three Tier Access Control security system is to provide a portable, high-efficiency, low-cost, and easy-to-use three-tier access control security system that provides a higher level of security.  As a security mechanism that protects an organization's private and restricted resources, the Three Tier Access Control security system combines biometric security and RFID systems. It employs a multi-factor authentication system that combines RFID cards, fingerprint scanning, and facial recognition to confirm an employee's identity. This approach will provide complete protection and ensure the overall security of the business. Administrators will be able to keep track of logs that show which employees were denied or granted access at any given time with the Three Tier Access Control System. 


## Features

- To identify the detect and recognize the face of the person requesting access
- To recognize and identify the fingerprint ID of the person 
- To read and authenticate a user using their RFID access card
- To keep track of door access, including time, user, and locker status
- To be able to add and remove users via web application interface

- [FastAPI] - a Web framework for developing RESTful APIs in Python.
- [MongoDB] - a source-available cross-platform document-oriented NoSQL database program
- [PostgreSQL] - a free and open-source relational database management system with SQL compliance
